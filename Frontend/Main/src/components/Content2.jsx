                                    Food Donation Connection provides an alternative to discarding surplus wholesome food by linking food service donors with surplus food to local hunger relief agencies. We do this by creating and maintaining an efficient communication and reporting network that links available sources of food to those in need through these existing charitable organizations. The LAX Harvest Food Donation Program is a shining example of how the Los Angeles International Airport community came together to make a tangible, positive difference in the lives of those around them.
